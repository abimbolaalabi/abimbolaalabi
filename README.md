## Frontend Developer
✏️ I've been diving into the world of coding for over a year, and it’s been an exciting journey! Starting with the essentials—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—I quickly developed a strong foundation in front-end development. I enjoy designing responsive and user-friendly applications that bring ideas to life on the screen. i have opened up new possibilities for creating robust, dynamic projects. As I continue to learn and grow, I’m always excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with others, and build impactful solutions that make a difference!

🌍  I'm based in Nigeria
🚀  I'm currentlylearning and improving on React.
🤝  I'm open to collaborating on innovative web design projects, interactive animations, and responsive front-end development.
⚡  I secretly dream of building an app that goes viral… but let’s keep that between us
